# Block-Dodger-2 💯💯💯

This is Block Dodger 2. It's a game I created where you control a white box (the player) and you must avoid the falling red blocks. A pretty simple game, I know.

I had previously made another version of this game. The reason I created an entirely different repository for version 2 is because I made version 2 with a virtual enviornment.
To play this game, download the GitHub folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder. Then, go to the `main.py` file and run it.


Hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had making it! 😁😁
