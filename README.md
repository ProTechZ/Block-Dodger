# Block Dodger 💯💯💯

This is Block Dodger. It's a game I created where you control a white box (the player) and you must avoid the falling red blocks. A pretty simple game, I know.

To play this game, download the GitHub folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the folder. Then, go to the `main.py` file and run it.


Hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had making it! 😁😁
